  <h2>This is my Quiz about some paragraph I found on the net.</h2>
  <h3>Read the paragraph carefully and answer the questions:</h3>
  <p>Alex couldn't go diving with his family because he had hurt his ankle in track practice. Despite his protests, his Mom ordered him to stay close to the hotel. While Alex was picking up the shells along the beach, he thought he heard a cry for
    help. He looked around, but he couldn't see anything. He heard the yell again, but this time louder and more desperate. A couple of yards away, he saw a girl frantically waving her arms, trying to grab something to keep her head above water.
    Without hesitation, Alex jumped in the water to save a stranger. After pulling the girl from the ocean, he was called a hero by everyone.</p>
