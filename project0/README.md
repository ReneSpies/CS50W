# Project 0

I wanted to make a quiz about a paragraph I found online and then, when I read the requirements, I thought it would be the easiest to make the question unrelated to the quiz. So the paragraph in index.html is basically useless.

All pages are showing a <nav> to let you navigate around the questions.

In question1.html you can find the usage of a table with some rather useless information. The radio buttons do not do anything, though.

question2.html shows a picture of Big Chungus and lets you guess which celebrity this picture shows.

For question3.html I am using the grid model to show 3 Big Chungus' in one row and three columns.

And, finally, to give my quiz a nice roundup and prevent a heavy cliffhanger I created finish.html which just tells you that you are finished and congratulates you.
